NightWatch
==========

A native android Nightscout client with alerts and google wear integration


# DOWNLOAD: 
* NightWatch v0.08 App for Phone & Watch: [NightWatch v0.08 apk](http://bit.ly/1CQmuHk)


## New in this version
* Backfill watch using data from the app
* Fix for local brodcasts of slope being converted into Deltas 


## Features
* MMOL support
* BG graph on watch!
* Scrollable, zoomable graph of bg over last 24 hours
* Retrieves Data from your existing NightScout site
* Customizable High and Low levels for graphs
* 4 (very similar) watchfaces (not making use of the new wear api, next time around though!)
* Built in Alert Notifications (Still needs a little bit of work)
* Ability to override phone silent mode on bg alerts
* **NOTE** if you want the graph, dont choose the ones that say LARGE, they just have bigger numbers and no graphs


## Why is it called NightWatch?
 Because its also an ANDROID WEAR WATCHFACE!!


## Future Updates:
* Nicer in phone app display
* In phone Widget
* MQTT support (once nightscout supports it)
* Alert Builder (set custom alerts for levels by time of day, different alert sounds, all that jazz)
* Preview images of the watchfaces when you are selecting them, sorry, mine wont let me do a screenshot for some reason!
